README: Predicting Ordinal Student Outcomes with OrdinalNet

This project uses R to develop and evaluate an ordinal regression model for predicting student performance (Post3Meta) based on features derived from MATHia learning data.



Input Files:

* student\_scores\_train.csv: Contains student outcome scores (Post3Meta).
* features.csv: Contains engineered features related to student activity.



Key Libraries

* tidymodels, tidymodels, dplyr, themis, caret, ordinalNet, ordinalgmifs, Metrics



Using Test Data

When applying the model to the test dataset, remember to bake the recipe on the test data before making predictions or further analysis (line 160).
