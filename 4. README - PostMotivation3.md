Ordinal Outcome Modeling with ordinalForest in R

We predict the PostMotivation3 score (a 7-point ordinal scale) using a subset of student-level features.



Input Files

* student\_scores\_train.csv – Contains outcome variable PostMotivation3 and student identifiers.
* features.csv – Contains various features for each student.



Key Libraries:

tidyverse, tidymodels, dplyr, themis, caret, ordinalForest, Metrics



Using Test Data

When applying the model to the test dataset, remember to bake the recipe on the test data before making predictions or further analysis (line 155).
